Feature: To support a wide range of BDD-frameworks a platform independent server shoud provide handy methods
  to collect step annotations.
 
  Background: ServerInstance
  Given I have a ServerInstance with EAFOutputFormat

  Scenario: Add Steps to buffer (Cucumber-JVM)
    Given I start a Scenario with description text "HelloScenario"
    When I add a Step "hello step",
    And I add a Step "hello step2",
    And I add the result "SUCCESS",
    And I add the result "FAILURE",
    And I stop the Scenario
    Then I should get a video with file named "HelloScenario"
    And I should get an annotation file named "HelloScenario",
    And the annotation file should contain steptext "hello step" with result "SUCCESS"
    And the annotation file should contain steptext "hello step2" with result "FAILURE"
    
  Scenario: AddResultsDirectly
    Given I start a Scenario with description text "HelloScenario"
    When I add a Step "hello step" with result "SUCCESS" after 3 Seconds,
    When I add a Step "hello step2" with result "ERROR" after 2 Seconds,
    And I stop the Scenario
    Then I should get a video with file named "HelloScenario"
    And I should get an annotation file named "HelloScenario" containing the added steps

  Scenario: Use of datatables
    Given I start a Scenario with description text "HelloScenario"
    When I add a Step "hello step" with Result "SUCCESS" and following Sample-Data:
      | Number | String   |
      | 1      | "test"   |
      | 2.34   | "^regex" |
      | 2,34   | null     |
    And I stop the Scenario
    Then I should get an annotation file named "HelloScenario" containing the added steps
