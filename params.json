{"name":"Bdd Videoannotator","tagline":"","body":"### Why ?\r\nBDD-based tests should improve the way you integrate the stakeholders in the development process. But is a textually story really suitable to describe the handling of the software using the GUI?\r\n\r\nYou can already set up click tests using automation Frameworks like [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to execute such an acceptance test. But as a result you only get a textual logfile that describes what happened on the front end.\r\n\r\nTo close this gap BDD Videoannotator can record a screencast that contains the steps specified in the BDD-Feature-Files.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nBDD Videoannotator is a plugin that can be used for various BDD-Tools. Currently there are two sample projects showing the usage of BDD-Videoannotator:\r\n* [Cucumber JVM in Java](https://github.com/shell88/bdd_videoannotator/tree/master/sampleCucumberJVM)\r\n* [Behat in PHP] (https://github.com/shell88/bdd_videoannotator/tree/master/sampleBehat)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nTo improve BDD Videoannoator please give your feedback by opening issues at the [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/shell88/bdd_videoannotator/issues)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
